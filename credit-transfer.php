                    <h2>To make things easy to understand, here is the basic process.</h2> 
                    <p>
                        Courses are designed in such a way that, each year/semester has a fixed total credit hours. So the Credit hours are equivalent to the attendance taken by the student in varies upon the university. Each class is worth the certain amount of credits. 1 credit hour normally equals one hour of class time per week. Most lecture only 
                        classes are 3 credit hours meaning you meet for about an hour 3 times a week. You will meet with a college adviser who will help you choose your classes and make sure you are getting in all required classes and credits for graduation. Basically if you attend all your classes, you will get the full credit and if you fail to do so they will give you credits according to your attendance. So if you are eligible and meet the requirement. Your application to most of university will be accepted easily.
